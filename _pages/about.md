I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the National University of Singapore. My research focuses primarily on learning dynamical systems, including their learning algorithms, mathematical foundations and scientific applications. A key emphasis is placed on integrating physical principles and structures while maintaining desirable theoretical properties and guarantees—which can be viewed as structure-preserving methods in the age of AI. I am also interested in deep learning techniques for solving PDEs, particularly those that  exploit their inherent mesh-free capabilities. Additionally, my work spans symplectic geometry algorithms and broader structure-preserving numerical methods, which form the foundation for much of my research at the intersection of AI and mathematical modeling.
